# physics_model_animations_cpp
3 projects prepared for "physical modeling in computer animation" classes using C++ openFrameworks toolkit (https://openframeworks.cc/). 
(5 semester of Applied Computer Science and Measurment Systems)

To run projects first of all must be downloaded openframeworks. 
After that put projects in of_v0.11.2_linux64gcc6_release/apps/myApps (version of openframeworks may be different, but 0.11.2+). 
Last things are change path to 'of' in 'config.make' of each project, 
run 'make' in projects directory and finally run 'make RunRelease'.
